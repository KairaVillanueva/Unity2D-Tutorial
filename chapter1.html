        <h4>Programming Terms</h4>
        <h2>Variables</h2>
        <p>It is a storage box. It literally lets you store any data type into a name you have created. For example, the type of data I want to store consists of the number <b>1</b>. I know <b>1</b> is an integer, so I will declare it with the type <b>int</b> which stands for <b>integer</b> and I will then store this type into <b>variable number</b>.</p><br>

        <p>How does this look like in C#?</p><br>

          <mark>int  number  = 1</mark><br><br>

        <p>This may seem abstract at first, but let us put it in terms of health points. In the game we will be creating, our spaceship has 5 health points before it vanishes, so in order for me to declare its health, I will need to store its health into a variable. Creating these variables is helpful because it saves the programmer the time to reiterate the numbers over and over again. Once a variable is created, the programmer can just reference that variable and use it throughout the script. </p><br>

        <p>You can also have the type <b>float</b> which takes in decimal points. In C#, <b>f</b> is added next to the decimal number to indicate that it is of type float.</p><br>

        <mark>float healthPoints = 5.0f;</mark><br><br>

        <p>When naming your variables using C#, there are some important rules to be followed. These names or identifiers cannot start with a number, cannot be a C# keyword, cannot start with a capital letter, and your identifiers need to be consistent.</p><br>
        <h3>NOPE:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><mark>float 1health = 5.0f;</mark></li>
          <li><mark>float case = 5.0f;</mark></li>
          <li><mark>float HealthPoints = 5.0f;</mark></li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Review:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><p>What and how are variables used?</p></li>
        <li><p>What should not you do when declaring identifiers for these variables?</p></li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Practice:</h2>
      <p>Here is a decent online <a href="http://rextester.com/runcode" target="_blank"><u>compiler</u></a>.</p><br>

      <p>You can use it to declare different types of variables and add these variables together to see what happens when you create identifiers along with them.</p><br>

      <p>If you want to see how it prints on the console, you will need to do this:</p><br>
      <mark>Console.WriteLine (identifier);</mark>
