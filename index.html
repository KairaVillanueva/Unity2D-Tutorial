      <h4>Unity 2D Space Shooter for the Absolute Beginner</h4><br>
        <p> I held a Unity2D Workshop with Code Liberation Foundation and I wanted to expand those concepts a bit more, so here is an ongoing chapter book that introduces computer science using Unity 2D.</p><br>

        <p> If you are a beginner and looking for tutorials in Unity2D, then I highly suggest jumping ahead and opening up the sample project from Unity because this will allow you to look at the sprites and other scripts that were implemented in the game by the Unity folks themselves.</p><br>

        <p>Here is the <u><a href="http://u3d.as/content/unity-technologies/unity-projects-2d-platformer/5m5">link</a></u> for that free 2D Platformer that Unity has provided. You can dissect its game design, code, animation, and all the other goodies included.</p><br>

        <p>Also, one of the best things about Unity is that they have meticulous documentation on anything that you could possibly think of and there are endless Q and A in their forums as well. If you have not done so, please look at <u><a href="http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/2d guideline" target="_blank">this</a></u> website for more guidelines concerning Unity2D. It will even show you the best practices and workflow of Unity2D, which is definitely valuable for anyone just wanting to feel out the UI of Unity.</p><br>

        <p>For the first part of this written tutorial, we will go over some of the basic programming terms and how it is going to be related to the game.</p><br>
