      <h4>Unity 2D Space Shooter for the Absolute Beginner</h4><br>
        <p> This past Saturday (Nov. 1) Code Liberation Foundation held a Unity2D Workshop and I was fortunate enough to instruct the class. Caroline, one of the teacher assistant for Code Liberation was also there to help out with the lesson. I underestimated the time we needed for the class, and it turns out that I was not able to finish up the whole game, but we were able to reach the part when the spaceship shoots out the bullets. I am going to blog about the whole game here, and the process of how to make your own Unity2D Space shooter.</p><br>

        <p> If you are a beginner and you have been looking for Unity tutorials in how to make your first Unity game, I suggest just jumping ahead and opening up the sample project from Unity because this will allow you to look at the sprites and other scripts that were implemented in the game.</p><br>

        <p>Here is the <a href="http://u3d.as/content/unity-technologies/unity-projects-2d-platformer/5m5">link</a> for that free 2D Platformer that Unity has provided. You can dissect its game design, code, animation, and all the other goodies included.</p><br>

        <p>Also, one of the best things about Unity is that they have meticulous documentation on anything that you could possibly think of and there are endless Q and A in their forums as well. If you have not done so, please look at <a href="http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/2d guideline" target="_blank"><u>this</u></a>  for beginner Unity2D. It will even show you the best practices and workflow of Unity2D, which is definitely valuable for anyone just wanting to feel out the UI of Unity.</p><br>

        <p>For the first part of this written tutorial, we will go over some of the basic programming terms and how it is going to be related to the game.</p><br>
